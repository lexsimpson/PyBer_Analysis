Here is a screenshot of the code I used to make a dataframe of the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver based upon the city type of rural, suburban, and urban. I first had to calculate the values seen here which I did by using the groupby() and sum() functions, then working them into my dataframe.

Here is my final graph, which is made into a line graph in order to visualize the differences between rural, suburban, and urban areas.

## Summary
In summary, urban areas performed much better than rural areas. This could be for several different reasons. In order to bridge the gap, and help rural areas gain more fares I would encourage hiring more drivers for this area. More drivers means more potential to pick up and gain fares for the area. In addition to this, I would encourage more ads. There is a possibility that people in this area just do not know the ride share resources that are available to them. Although, it makes sense that urban areas would perform better. There is a concentrated amount of people in urban areas which means more potential for rides.
